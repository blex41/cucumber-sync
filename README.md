# cucumber-sync

> WIP: This package is far from being done. Don't use it.

Synchronize your Cucumber Studio tests with your code. This package allows you to load test suites from Cucumber Studio automatically, either locally or in a CI. Tests can be detected dinamically depending on which feature you are working on, if you and your team use tags.
